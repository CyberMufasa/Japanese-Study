Files for studying Japanese.

I will be uploading my files that I create for studying as I can't find a set that I like already created.
I am also attempting this on my spare time, which is way more difficult than when I took it as a course in university.

I am taking these as resources from other people's posts, and textbooks so I do not own the snippets I am using. This is just a nice resource to organize my notes so that I don't lose them.
